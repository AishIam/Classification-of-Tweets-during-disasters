Projects: Vaccine Stance Classification Model

Description:
Led the development of a robust machine learning model for Vaccine Stance Classification using Twitter data. This project aimed to categorize tweets into positive, negative, or neutral stances regarding vaccines, contributing to sentiment analysis and public health awareness.

Key Components:

Data Collection:

Gathered a diverse and representative dataset of tweets related to vaccines from the Twitter API, ensuring a broad spectrum of opinions and sentiments.
Data Preprocessing:

Conducted extensive data preprocessing, including text cleaning, tokenization, and stemming, to prepare the Twitter data for effective model training.
Feature Engineering:

Extracted relevant features from the tweets, incorporating both textual and contextual information to enhance the model's understanding of vaccine-related sentiments.
Machine Learning Model Selection:

Explored and evaluated various machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Neural Networks to identify the most suitable model for the task.
Model Training and Tuning:

Trained the selected machine learning model on the preprocessed dataset, fine-tuning hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Evaluation Metrics:

Employed metrics such as confusion matrix, precision-recall curves, and ROC-AUC to assess the model's performance and validate its effectiveness in accurately classifying vaccine stances.
Integration for Real-time Analysis:

Integrated the trained model into a scalable and efficient system, allowing real-time analysis of Twitter data and providing instantaneous categorization of vaccine-related tweets.

Outcome:
The developed Vaccine Stance Classification model demonstrated high accuracy in categorizing tweets into positive, negative, or neutral stances. Its real-time analysis capabilities contribute to ongoing sentiment analysis efforts and public health awareness campaigns by providing timely insights into public perceptions of vaccines.
